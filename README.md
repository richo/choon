Music controller for pebble.

# How to make it go:

1. Get the bluetooth address of your pebble:

    Settings > About > BT Address

2. Remove the colons, save that address in ALLCAPS in a file called .choon in your home directory

3. Install [the app](https://github.com/richo/choon-cocoa)

4. Run everything.

I'm using httpebble, so it'll clobber any other app with the same uuid
